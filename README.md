# CS170
Project #1 for CS170 Intro to AI
Github removed support for password authentication last year so I have to manually add files rather than committing and pushing files remotely.
Some errors may arise from trying to compile/run the code directly from here, worst case scenario the code on my own machine should hopefully work.

Unrelated Appreciative Note: Thanks for the extra day extension to allow us to enjoy Halloween, I had plans that were planned months in advance and the extra day was a huge relief. Cheers.
